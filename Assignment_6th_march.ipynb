    "Mean:\n",
    "The mean is the most common measure of central tendency. It is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of observations. The mean takes into account every data point and is sensitive to outliers. It is used to describe the average value of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not influenced by extreme values (outliers) and is particularly useful when dealing with skewed or non-normally distributed data. The median is used to describe the \"typical\" value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "The mode represents the value(s) that appear most frequently in a dataset. Unlike the mean and median, which are numerical values, the mode can be applicable to both numerical and categorical variables. It is used to describe the most common value or category in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "Measures of variability provide information about the spread, dispersion, or variability of the data points in a dataset. They describe how the values are distributed around the central tendency.\n",

    "Range:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of variability, calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the dataset. It provides a measure of the total spread of the data but is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "Variance quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It gives a measure of how spread out the dataset is. Variance considers all data points, but the squared units make it difficult to interpret directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a more easily interpretable measure of variability in the same units as the original data. A higher standard deviation indicates greater dispersion or variability of the data points from the mean.\"\"\""
